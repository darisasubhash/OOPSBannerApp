🧩 OOPS Banner Application (UC1 → UC8) 📌 Project Overview

The OOPS Banner Application is a progressive Java console-based project designed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, clean code practices, and incremental refactoring.

The project starts from a simple console print (UC1) and evolves step by step into a scalable, modular banner rendering engine (UC8) using advanced Java concepts such as arrays, methods, collections, HashMap, StringBuilder, and OOPS design principles. 🎯 Objective

Print the word “OOPS” in a banner format using ASCII art
Improve the solution incrementally through multiple use cases
Demonstrate refactoring, modularity, reusability, and clean architecture
Apply real-world OOPS concepts in a structured way

OOPS-Banner-App/ │ ├── src/ │ └── OOPSBannerApp.java │ ├── README.md └── .gitignore 🚀 Use Case Breakdown ✅ UC1: Print Simple OOPS

Prints OOPS as plain text
Focus: Basic Java syntax
✅ UC2: Banner using Print Statements

ASCII art using System.out.println()
Uses * and spaces
Drawback: Hardcoded and repetitive
✅ UC3: Banner using String.join()

Replaces + operator with String.join()
Improves memory efficiency
✅ UC4: Banner using String Array & Loop

Stores banner lines in a String[]
Uses loop for rendering
Improves modularity
✅ UC5: Inline Array Initialization

Combines declaration and initialization
Uses String.join() inline
Reduces verbosity
✅ UC6: Refactor Banner Logic into Methods

Separate methods for O, P, S
Applies DRY Principle
Improves reusability
✅ UC7: Store Character Pattern in a Class

Introduces CharacterPatternMap class
Encapsulates character → pattern mapping
Demonstrates OOPS principles
✅ UC8: Use HashMap for Character Patterns

Uses HashMap<Character, String[]>
Enables O(1) lookup
Uses StringBuilder and nested loops
Fully scalable banner engine
🧠 OOPS Concepts Demonstrated

Encapsulation
Abstraction
Modularity
Reusability
Single Responsibility Principle
Separation of Concerns
📈 Learning Outcomes
